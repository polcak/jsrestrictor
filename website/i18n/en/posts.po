"[Browser fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01051.pdf) is a more and"
" more popular technique used to identify browsers. The fingerprint is "
"computed based on the results of JavaScript calls, the content of HTTP "
"headers, hardware characteristics, underlying operating system and other "
"software information. Consequently, browser fingerprints are used for cross-"
"domain tracking. However, users cannot clear their browser fingerprint as it"
" is not stored on the client-side. It is also challenging to determine "
"whether a browser is being fingerprinted."
msgstr ""

#: ../content/posts/farbling.md:block 3 (paragraph)

"Another issue that hinders fingerprinting protection is the ever-changing "
"variety of supported APIs. Browsers implement new APIs over time, and "

"attempts."

"Why is Brave's Farbling special? Until recently, [Tor "
"browser](https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-"
"linkability) had the most robust defence against fingerprinting. It (1) "
"implemented modifications in various APIs, (2) blocks some other APIs, (3) "
"runs in a window of predefined size, etc. to ensure all users have the same "
"fingerprint. This approach is very effective at producing uniform "
"fingerprint for all users, which makes it difficult for fingerprinters to "
"differentiate between browsers. Still, such fingerprint is also brittle -- "
"minor changes like resizing the window could cause the browser to have a "
"unique fingerprint. Hence, users need to follow inconvenient steps to keep "
"their fingerprint uniform."

"With all this in [mind](https://brave.com/brave-fingerprinting-and-privacy-"

"protection. They [proposed](https://brave.com/privacy-updates-3/) new "
"fingerprinting protection, Farbling, arguing that it is (almost) impossible "
"to produce uniform fingerprint without compromising user experience. Their "
"countermeasures involve randomising values based on previous research papers"
" [PriVaricator](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~livshits/papers/pdf/www15.pdf) and"
" [FPRandom](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01527580/document) Both papers have "

"In short, browser fingerprinting is a stateless tracking method vastly "
"prevalent on the web in recent years. Similarly to a human *fingerprint*, "
"browser fingerprinting tries to find a set of features that make (almost) "
"every fingerprint unique and the browser uniquely identifiable."

"The fingerprinting features contain various sources, mostly accessible "
"through browser application interfaces, APIs. The APIs provide essential "
"functionality for modern websites; however, they leak sensitive information "
"about the browser, operating system, or device itself. Many different "
"devices are connected to the internet — most of them with a very specific "
"configuration. Leaking hardware and software properties may result in a "
"sufficiently identifiable browser fingerprint. Furthermore, do not forget "
"about the possibility of leaking information that may uncover "
"vulnerabilities of your system for the sake of potential attackers."

"Secondly, there is *a positive or constructive use case*, where websites "
"tend to collect information about your system to improve the usability or "

"installing critical security updates based on your system properties. Some "
"websites collect browser fingerprints to verify known devices of their users"

"Unlike cookies, browser fingerprinting does not require storing an "
"identifier on the device. Instead, the identifier is recomputed with each "
"visited page. Once the fingerprint is obtained, it can be sent to a tracking"
" server in a subsequent request. Moreover, the whole process of fingerprint "
"extraction is invisible to a user. There are many sources of potentially "
"identifiable information from which a fingerprint can be constructed. A "
"fingerprint is considered *passive* when it contains natively accessible "
"information from HTTP headers or network traffic. On the other hand, "
"*active* fingerprint runs JavaScript code to retrieve data from browser "
"APIs. JShelter focuses on detecting and preventing active fingerprinting."

"[Modifying the content of fingerprints](/farbling/) is a valid choice to "
"resist a fingerprinting attempt. However, each modification may create an "
"inconsistency that may improve the fingerprintability of the browser. Many "

"Another approach is to create homogeneous fingerprints. If every fingerprint"
" is the same, there is no way to tell the users behind the browsers apart. "
"The leading representative of this approach is the [Tor "
"browser](https://www.torproject.org/). Level 3 of JShelter aims to create a "
"homogenous fingerprint. Unfortunately, homogeneous fingerprints have an "
"inherent downside of following specific rules to be effective. Most "
"importantly, the effectiveness of the approach depends on the broad coverage"
" of the blocked APIs and the size of the population employing the counter-"
"measures. All browsers with the same fingerprint form an anonymity set. An "
"observer cannot distinguish between browsers in the anonymity set. With "
"every missed fingerprintable attribute, the anonymity set breaks into "
"smaller sets. For example, the Tor browser strongly recommends using a "
"specific window size. Suppose you use a window size different from all other"
" Tor browser users. In that case, a fingerprinter can identify you solely by"
" this attribute. Also, keep in mind that Tor browser hides your IP address, "
"which JShelter does not do. Hence we see Level 3 protections more as leak "
"prevention than an anti-fingerprinting measure. If you like the idea of "
"homogeneous fingerprints, install Tor browser."

"[Brave browser](https://brave.com/) modifies the readings from APIs misused "

"activities is smaller. JShelter already [implements the farbling protection "

"Recently, we added [Fingerprint detector (FPD)](/fpdetection/) to JShelter. "
"FPD does not modify the fingerprint. Instead, FPD monitors APIs that are "
"often misused by fingerprinters. When FPD detects a fingerprinting attempt, "
"it warns the user. You can also allow FPD to block all subsequent "
"transmissions of the page and remove stored data to prevent storing the "

"It is hard, if not impossible, to both prevent fingerprinting and still "
"provide customized environment for the user. Hence, we want to identify "
"fingerprinting attempts by counting the number of different APIs employed by"
" a page, especially APIs that are not frequently used for benign purposes. "
"When a fingerprinting attempt is identified, we want to (1) inform the user,"
" (2) prevent uploading of the fingerprint to the server, (3) prevent storing"
" the fingerprint for later usage."
