#  You can change testing browsers and JSR levels.

## Getter for values in Config class
#
#  Do not use direct access to Config from other modules. Always get values through this getter.
#  It is because of paths. This getter guarantees uniform way of writing paths in Config class for every supported OS.
#  Before getting a path, this path is updated in this getter according current OS.
